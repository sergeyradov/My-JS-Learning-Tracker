**My Learning Tracker**
------------
The idea is possessed from [My-Learning-Tracker](https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker)

I have been motivated by Syk Houdeib after reading his article at Medium. Here is a link 

[How I switched careers and got a developer job in 10 months a true story](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-switched-careers-and-got-a-developer-job-in-10-months-a-true-story-b8895e855a8b)

I am already a **performance engineer** for more than 10 years, but I feel an need to upgrade my knowledge and grow up to Full Stack Web Developer.
I will go over following table and mark skills that I can re-use from existing career already such as GIT
